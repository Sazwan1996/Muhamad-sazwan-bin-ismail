It seems like you're trying to reference a GitHub repository, but the URL you provided is not valid. Here's why:

1. **Invalid Username**: GitHub usernames cannot contain special characters like `@` or periods (`.`) in this context.
2. **Invalid Repository Name**: Repository names should not include special characters like `@` or `.com`.

If your GitHub username is `Sazwan1996`, a valid GitHub repository URL would look like this:

```
https://github.com/Sazwan1996/repository-name
```

### Steps to Create a GitHub Repository
If you're trying to create a new repository, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in with your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select `New repository`.
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., `my-project`).
   - Add a description (optional).
   - Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
   - Click `Create repository`.

3. **Clone the Repository Locally**:
   - Run the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Sazwan1996/repository-name.git
     cd repository-name
     ```

4. **Add a README.md File**:
   - Create a `README.md` file:
     ```bash
     echo "# My Project" > README.md
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README.md"
     git push origin main
     ```
